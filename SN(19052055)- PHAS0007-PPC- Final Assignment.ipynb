    "### Conclusion and Dicussion:\n",
    "The code works well providing the assumptions made, however, lacks a more realistic grounding, it could be improved by:\n",
    "* Dont consider the ball a point mass and include air resistance, this would give a more physical spin and affect the projectial mostion and range. This could be included by using vectors for the forces on the projectile and then use these to get the corresponding equations of motion for inside the loop.\n",
    "* Consider both the ball hitting the wall and ground as inelastic collision, including bonce's off of the surfcae's. in addition, this would change the energy transfer  to the wall effecting rotation. For this we would have to include a coefficient of restition of the surfaces.\n",
    "* Consider restoring torque as a vector, from this we could get expression for resulting torque from the ball and  modelling with shm, could get equation of motion to make the wall wobble at lower torques, and only if the torque goes beyond pivot point there is collapse, this could be done with `while` loop for equation of motion and using and `if` to detect when it is beyond pivot point.\n",
    "* If we used very large distances we could also take account for the curvature of the earth, this could be done by a more rigid model of gravity, using the gravitational force vector to define the projectiles motion.."
